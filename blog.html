            <blockquote style="margin-top:10px;">
              <em class="os">This legislation is <strong>sweeping, dangerously vague, and likely ineffective</strong>. The Conservatives have played politics and intimidated the Liberals into giving them a blank cheque to pass any law, even one like C-51 that <strong>goes too far.</strong><p class="os" style="font-size:0.8em;">- NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair</p></em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan by the government “goes too far” says NDP leader Thomas Mulcair. “We in the NDP are going to fight it.”</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government has proposed omnibus bill C-51, dubbed the “anti-terror”bill, which aims to do just that. It promises to fight terrorism by giving internet authorities such as CSIS sweeping powers to investigate any suspected case of terrorism, or relations to it. The crux of the matter is that the bill is worded in such a way so that any suspected case of terrorism can be investigated fully, revealing your entire browsing history and internet activity including emails, and other activities such as texts. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP is concerned that because of the vague wording of the bill, other activities that happen to fall under the vast umbrella of “terrorism” can be punishable by law, activities such as protests to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline; protests which would interfere with infrastructure and economic stability. The party aims to protect the innocent people who may be classified as terrorists under the bill. Criticism from the NDP concerning the bill’s broad language was promptly rejected by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Harper, of course, used this opportunity to bash the NDP, saying that “with the NDP it would be only a matter of a couple of weeks before we got into this kind of conspiracy.” He went on to say that due to the nature and danger of terrorist, agencies should be able to have broad powers to make preventative arrests.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article outlines the possible impacts of the broad language of the bill on innocent people. This would impact protesters of economic and infrastructure activities. In addition, this may have recurring impacts on the government itself, with this bill creating so much controversy that the Conservatives may not see another year in power, dethroned in favor of the NDP.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this article is slightly biased, taking the side of the NDP. It seems to criticize the amount of power given to CSIS. The author does not seem to support the Liberals backing the bill either, saying that Trudeau backed the bill “despite the lack of parliamentary oversight of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.” The wording of the article suggests that the bill is alright, but sides with the NDP on the fact that the wording is too broad. We can infer that if the bill’s wording were to be changed to target only actual terrorists, the author would agree with it.

            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 24, 2015</p>

            <blockquote style="margin-top:10px;">
              <em class="os">“Give at least most of those who want to be heard a <strong>chance to be heard</strong>. Let’s make sure we have the <strong>best possible bill </strong>at the end of the day.”</em><p class="os" style="font-size:0.8em;">- Liberal Public Safety Critic Wayne Easter</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harper is trying to push his new anti-terrorism bill through parliament as fast as he can, hoping that it will become law before the summer. What this means is that he is going to restrict the study of Bill C-51 to only 18 professionals, so that less time is spent studying the bill, and more on passing it through. This created a problem with the opposition parties, who want their experts to be heard, but harper not wanting to hear them. At last count, the Liberals had almost 30 witnesses, and the NDP had over 50. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harper has reasoned that his decision was the right one because a recent poll found that a majority of Canadians support Bill C-51; therefore, the bill can be passed with little to no study. The Liberals have said that opposition parties were willing to listen to more testimony if it meant that the Bill would get more oversight.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An underlying problem with Bill C-51 is that it gives sweeping powers to Canada’s spy agencies. CSIS was created as an organisation to oversee the RCMP, who had violated some rules in the past. With the passing of this bill, CSIS would be given more power to arrest people without any evidence to do so. The problem with this is that CSIS itself has no oversight.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of this article, once again, seems to be biased towards the side of anti-C51. There is no testimony from the Conservatives, making it bias by omission. The testimony that was included was only from supporters of free speech, saying that the Conservatives should allow everyone to speak, as it is a part of democracy. And if the opposition parties are willing to listen to more testimony, why should we stop them? It is an issue affecting almost every single Canadian, as it is their security and privacy on the line.</p>
