            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harper’s Bill C-51 is not only a threat to Canadians, but all countries in the Five Eyes Alliance. This would be America, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. A long standing agreement between these five countries has allowed for information sharing between them. It is also one of the largest espionage alliances in history. </p>

            <img src="https://blog.glyphobet.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Five-Eyes.png" width="600" style="margin-bottom:10px;"></img>
                
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let’s be fair here. We’re dealing with Canadians, not whatever is going on in the rest of the world. If a stranger walked into your house, took all of your private information, and walked out while you watched him do it, would you be mad? Of course you would. This is exactly what Harper is doing with his new bill. Except instead of breaking and entering, they’re doing it legally. And you don’t know theres someone stealing your information. And instead of them being in your house, they’re hundreds of kilometers away in a shady-looking building on the side of the road in the middle of who knows where. “But why should it matter if it’s legal?” you say. “Just because it’s legal doesn’t mean it’s morally justified.” And you would be absolutely right. But Harper doesn’t seem to care about this fact. And so, he continues with the express purpose of pushing this bill through Parliament as fast as he can. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I read something about being detained without any evidence. How is that legal?” you ask. And the answer is that the bill clearly outlines this fact. You may find yourself talking to someone who the government thinks you shouldn’t be talking to. And suddenly, all of your information is released to the Five Eyes countries, and you’re sitting in a jail cell for 7 days. 7 entire days. That’s more than enough time to lose your job, create strains within your family, and fall behind on mortgage payments. Turns out you did nothing wrong? Oh well. Back to your house (if it’s still there), and maybe, if you’re lucky, you’ll get an apology. But don’t worry. Harper’s keeping you safe. Right?</p>

            <img src="http://faradayschools.com/wp-content/uploads/proof.jpg"></img>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Somehow they dug up something from years ago that links me to something I didn’t even know about. What do I do now?” you ask. And the answer is nothing. In Harper’s eyes, you’re one of them. Pick a number between 1 and 10. Multiply that number by 5. Add 124. Divide by your original number. Now disregard that number, and Harper will decide on one for you. That’s the number of years you’ll spend in jail, on a random number of charges; anywhere from 10 to 50 counts of some fancy-looking word. But wait! There’s more! You can be driven to a shady-looking building hundreds of years old and all the way out there in the woods, get your life beaten out of you while some official looking guy is asking you questions that won’t make sense in your beaten state. And when you finally babble out some nonsensical answer to make the torture stop? Turns out they were recording it the entire time. They simply clip the parts where you’re screaming for your life, and suddenly they have an admission of guilt recorded on audio. Back to jail, for another undisclosed amount of years, for who knows how many charges of whatever.</p>
            <p>Welcome to Canada. We hope you enjoy your stay.</p>

            <blockquote style="margin-top:10px;">
              <em class="os">Should news agencies stick to reporting the facts?</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these two articles are from reputable news agencies, they are indisputably biased, whether it be through omission, selection, or a multitude of other reasons. First I’ll start off with the Globe and Mail article. The title of which, is “NDP vows to fight anti-terror bill, saying it ‘goes too far’”. There is clearly a bias by selection here, as the headline itself is an NDP quote, and the topic is also based on the NDP’s views, and none of the other parties. The quote from Harper in the article makes it sound like Harper is being unreasonable, saying that “We knew that with the NDP it would be only a matter of a couple of weeks before we got into this kind of conspiracy.” The Globe and Mail tries to make Harper seem like the big bad wolf while the NDP is envisioned as the angel savior. Another selection from the Globe and Mail article states that the Liberal party would continue to side with the government “despite the lack of parliamentary oversight of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.” The author of this article felt the need to express his disapproval through facts such as said lack of oversight. In addition, the article consists of mainly NDP quotes compared to one of the Conservatives.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the other side of the political spectrum, we have the Toronto Star. While this article is not as blatantly biased as the previous, it still has some expertly crafted information within. The author felt that it was appropriate to include some background information; however, the information that was included was mainly about the NDP losing Canadian faith, as well as subsequent elections. The article also stated that “the Conservative majority will see this bill passed in the end.” While this isn’t as biased by itself, the fact that it was included in this article makes it appear that the author has given up on supporting the NDP’s stance on this bill. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although news agencies are supposed to report news with a centrist, 3rd party, or indifferent viewpoint, these two articles do not appear to be doing so. And so, I have a question: Should the media be playing a part in supporting political views? Or should they stick to reporting the facts, and only the facts? But in the end, the articles themselves were reported relatively fairly, although the information included hinted to one side or another.

            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this cartoon, we see Harper spying on what is assumed to be Canadians through the obvious Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It clearly illustrates the fact that Harper is disregarding the rights (hence him staring through a hole) of Canadians to collect information for whatever purposes he intends to do. The size of the hole in the Charter illustrates how large of a problem this is, or how many rights he has disregarded for his own needs. He appears to be wearing a trenchcoat, which is often associated with private investigators, or spies in disguise. This implies the fact that he is doing this information collecting secretly, and combined with the binoculars (far away), it adds to the cartoon by saying that Harper can collect any of your information, while disregarding your rights, as well as you not knowing about it. And so, while Canadians mind their own business, Harper is allowed to snoop through all their personal lives, completely disregarding the rights that Canadians all deserve.</p>

            <p>Hey! You made it all the way here! I promise we'll be done soon, but first, here a some questions.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Do Canadians have the right to privacy and security (if not, then who does)? Is it possible to have a balance between both? </li>
              <li>Is there an ulterior motive to Harper’s Bill C-51? Or is it just poor choice of wording?</li>
              <li>How does this affect people in other countries? Consider spy agencies overseas.</li>
              <li>How will the passing/denial of this bill affect future bills? Consider what has been done so far to get this bill through parliament.</li>
              <li>How will this bill affect rights in Canada? Consider new (anti) privacy laws.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And so, that concludes this website. I hope you had fun! I sure did, with the bashing of Harper and whatnot. Until next time!</p>
