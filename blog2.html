            <blockquote style="margin-top:10px;">
              <em class="os"> [T]he bill <strong>“chills speech, deters participation</strong> in counter-violent extremism programs and <strong>sets up a brave new world</strong> in terms of what the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) can do.”</em><p class="os" style="font-size:0.8em;">- Craig Forcese, Professor at the University of Ottawa</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harper’s Bill C-51 has come under a lot of fire recently, and there seems to be no end in sight. The anti-terrorism act is “dangerous” according to 100 academics, because it does not provide appropriate safeguards to keep Canadians safe from false arrests. Moreover, the fact that the legislation has changed the threshold for arrests from “a terrorist act will be carried out” to “may be carried out” has critics worried that the possibility for abuse is extremely high. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSIS’s watchdog agency has recently been starved of staff (see <a style="color:#00CCFF !important;" href="http://www.cbc.ca/newspolitics/csis-watchdog-agency-starved-of-staff-resources-1.2965276" >this</a> article.), making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ensure that Canadians are appropriately protected, and that nobody will be arrested on false pretenses. The agency now has only 16 lawyers working full time to ensure that CSIS and all of the activities that it does are within bounds and do not break any legislation or rights. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All this conducted in an environment where indisputably our review system is in tatters," says Craig Forcese, a professor at the University of Ottawa. He added that the bill “chills speech, deters participation in counter-violent extremism programs and sets up a brave new world in terms of what the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) can do.”</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conservatives argue that the powers given to CSIS in C-51 are justified, to reduce the threat of terrorism to this country. But the broad powers would allow CSIS to share its information with its partners overseas in Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. The fact that there are no regulations in place to ensure that the privacy of Canadians is protected is only more reason to why this bill needs more oversight.
            "It is sadly ironic that democratic debate is being curtailed on a bill that vastly expands the scope of covert state activity when that activity will be subject to poor or even non-existent democratic oversight or review." they say.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article was written with the sole intent to explain why this bill should not be passed, or at least drastically modified to protect the security and privacy of Canadians. Even the title points to a more sinister agenda behind the bill’s “anti-terrorism” front, using words such as “dangerous”.  
            This article itself really only affects the parties currently sitting in the house of commons, but mainly the Conservatives, as that is the party which supported the bill. However, the bill itself is a piece of legislation that affects all Canadians, and the article urges Canadians to take a vested interest in this bill.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title" style="font-size:1.75em;">Bill C-51 Greenlights Intel Gained by Torture</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 6, 2015</p>
            <hr></hr>
            <img src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1063369/images/o-ELIZABETH-MAY-facebook.jpg" style="width:100%; margin-left:0%; margin-right:auto;"></img>
            <blockquote style="margin-top:10px;">
              <em class="os">"<strong>For years now,</strong> I have been worried about whether CSIS uses evidence <strong>obtained through torture</strong> in security certificate cases,"</em><p class="os" style="font-size:0.8em;">- Green Party Leader Elizabeth May</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-51 has been at the top of Canadian headlines for the past month, until disappearing for a few days. But now, its back again, and uglier than ever. The Green Party points out a fact that the ‘anti-terror’ bill will allow any “actionable intelligence” it finds in a court setting. This means that any and all evidence that it finds, through means such as torture, are allowed. So long have Canadians become used to the fact that evidence obtained illegally cannot be used in court, but that fact is going to become another part of history. Under a new clause, the law reads: “the judge may receive into evidence anything that, in the judge's opinion, is reliable and appropriate, even if it is inadmissible in a court of law, and may base a decision on that evidence.” Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in a news release: “For years now, I have been worried about whether CSIS uses evidence obtained through torture in security certificate cases." And it looks like this will be the case soon.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that’s not all. Under a clause in Bill C-44, Canada’s other spying bill, CSIS has the right to keep its sources confidential. Which means this, combined with the aforementioned C-51 clause, would allow CSIS to introduce evidence gained by torture, without saying it was. This “will let the Canadian Government detain and deport people based on information obtained by ostensibly hooking up someone's genitals to a car battery” said May. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians should all be worried about the new legislation. With police having sweeping powers, it is only a matter of time before stories of abuse dominate the headlines. CSIS no longer needs evidence to act upon suspected terror threats, nor do they need to refrain from using torture to get even more information. Even amidst new studies that shows that even intensive interrogation may lead to false evidence, the Conservatives continue to press onwards with this new bill. Perhaps there is a more sinister undertone to it.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with this, we say goodbye to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; the Conservatives won’t miss you.</p>
