              <em class="os"> [T]he bill <strong>“chills speech, deters participation</strong> in counter-violent extremism programs and <strong>sets up a brave new world</strong> in terms of what the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) can do.”</em><p class="os" style="font-size:0.8em;">- Craig Forcese, Professor at the University of Ottawa</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harper’s Bill C-51 has come under a lot of fire recently, and there seems to be no end in sight. The anti-terrorism act is “dangerous” according to 100 academics, because it does not provide appropriate safeguards to keep Canadians safe from false arrests. Moreover, the fact that the legislation has changed the threshold for arrests from “a terrorist act will be carried out” to “may be carried out” has critics worried that the possibility for abuse is extremely high. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSIS’s watchdog agency has recently been starved of staff (see <a style="color:#00CCFF !important;" href="http://www.cbc.ca/newspolitics/csis-watchdog-agency-starved-of-staff-resources-1.2965276" >this</a> article.), making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ensure that Canadians are appropriately protected, and that nobody will be arrested on false pretenses. The agency now has only 16 lawyers working full time to ensure that CSIS and all of the activities that it does are within bounds and do not break any legislation or rights. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All this conducted in an environment where indisputably our review system is in tatters," says Craig Forcese, a professor at the University of Ottawa. He added that the bill “chills speech, deters participation in counter-violent extremism programs and sets up a brave new world in terms of what the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) can do.”</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conservatives argue that the powers given to CSIS in C-51 are justified, to reduce the threat of terrorism to this country. But the broad powers would allow CSIS to share its information with its partners overseas in Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. The fact that there are no regulations in place to ensure that the privacy of Canadians is protected is only more reason to why this bill needs more oversight.
            "It is sadly ironic that democratic debate is being curtailed on a bill that vastly expands the scope of covert state activity when that activity will be subject to poor or even non-existent democratic oversight or review." they say.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article was written with the sole intent to explain why this bill should not be passed, or at least drastically modified to protect the security and privacy of Canadians. Even the title points to a more sinister agenda behind the bill’s “anti-terrorism” front, using words such as “dangerous”.  
            This article itself really only affects the parties currently sitting in the house of commons, but mainly the Conservatives, as that is the party which supported the bill. However, the bill itself is a piece of legislation that affects all Canadians, and the article urges Canadians to take a vested interest in this bill.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 24, 2015</p>
            <hr></hr>

            <blockquote style="margin-top:10px;">
              <em class="os">“Give at least most of those who want to be heard a <strong>chance to be heard</strong>. Let’s make sure we have the <strong>best possible bill </strong>at the end of the day.”</em><p class="os" style="font-size:0.8em;">- Liberal Public Safety Critic Wayne Easter</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harper is trying to push his new anti-terrorism bill through parliament as fast as he can, hoping that it will become law before the summer. What this means is that he is going to restrict the study of Bill C-51 to only 18 professionals, so that less time is spent studying the bill, and more on passing it through. This created a problem with the opposition parties, who want their experts to be heard, but harper not wanting to hear them. At last count, the Liberals had almost 30 witnesses, and the NDP had over 50. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harper has reasoned that his decision was the right one because a recent poll found that a majority of Canadians support Bill C-51; therefore, the bill can be passed with little to no study. The Liberals have said that opposition parties were willing to listen to more testimony if it meant that the Bill would get more oversight.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An underlying problem with Bill C-51 is that it gives sweeping powers to Canada’s spy agencies. CSIS was created as an organisation to oversee the RCMP, who had violated some rules in the past. With the passing of this bill, CSIS would be given more power to arrest people without any evidence to do so. The problem with this is that CSIS itself has no oversight.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of this article, once again, seems to be biased towards the side of anti-C51. There is no testimony from the Conservatives, making it bias by omission. The testimony that was included was only from supporters of free speech, saying that the Conservatives should allow everyone to speak, as it is a part of democracy. And if the opposition parties are willing to listen to more testimony, why should we stop them? It is an issue affecting almost every single Canadian, as it is their security and privacy on the line.</p>
